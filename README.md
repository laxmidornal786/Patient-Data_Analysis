This project presents a comprehensive and insightful Patient Data Analysis system. The analysis enables healthcare stakeholders to explore patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment patterns, and outcomes through data-driven insights. The ultimate goal is to improve decision-making, patient care, and hospital resource allocation.

1. Overview
This project focuses on analyzing patient health records to identify key trends, risk factors, and outcomes that can help healthcare providers enhance clinical efficiency. The analysis includes patient demographics, diagnosis tracking, treatment effectiveness, and readmission prediction.

2. Dashboard / Analysis Description
The analysis provides clear visualizations and metrics such as patient age distribution, common diseases, treatment success rates, length of hospital stay, and readmission risks. Interactive dashboards and reports allow healthcare professionals to drill down into specific patient segments for deeper insights.

3. Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw patient records.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and anomalies.
Visualize key healthcare metrics and trends.
Identify high-risk patients and critical factors affecting outcomes.
Provide actionable insights for improving patient care and hospital efficiency.
